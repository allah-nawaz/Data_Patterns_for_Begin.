#  Understanding Data Patterns and Trends — Beginner Friendly Guide

## 🧩 Example Data

| Day | Sales |
|-----|-------|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 10 |
| 3 | 15 |
| 4 | 20 |
| 5 | 25 |

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Observe the Change

We can check how much sales change each day:

- 10 – 5 = **+5**  
- 15 – 10 = **+5**  
- 20 – 15 = **+5**  
- 25 – 20 = **+5**

👉 The change is always the same (+5).  
This means there is a **clear pattern** or **trend** in the data.

---

## 📈 Step 2: Identify the Pattern

Since the difference is always **+5**, we can say:

> "Sales are increasing by 5 units each day."

This is known as a **linear trend** (a straight-line pattern).

---

## 🔮 Step 3: Make a Prediction

If the pattern continues:
- Next day (Day 6) = 25 + 5 = **30**

✅ So we can predict that **sales on Day 6 will be around 30.**

## 💡 What We Did

We just performed **basic forecasting** — predicting the future using past data.

| Concept | What We Found |
|----------|----------------|
| **Trend** | Upward (+5 each day) |
| **Rate of change** | Constant (5) |
| **Prediction** | Next = 30 |

## 🧠 Why It Matters (as a Data Analyst)

When analyzing data, these patterns help businesses:

- **See growth or decline** (📈 or 📉)
- **Plan inventory and targets**
- **Understand customer behavior**
- **Make data-driven decisions**

### Example:
> “Our sales increase by 5 units daily.  
> If the trend continues, tomorrow’s sales may reach 30.  
> We should prepare extra stock.”

That’s called **data storytelling** — turning numbers into business insights.

## 📊 Bonus: Two Ways to Show Growth

| Type | Example |
|------|----------|
| **Absolute Increase** | +5 each day |
| **Relative (Percentage) Increase** | (5 ÷ 25) × 100 = **20% growth** |

## 🏁 Conclusion

✅ You observed data  
✅ Found a pattern  
✅ Predicted future values  
✅ Explained what it means for business

That’s exactly how a **Data Analyst** thinks and works!
